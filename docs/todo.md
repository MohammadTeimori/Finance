PE Ratio (Trailing and Forward):
PE Ratio helps investors evaluate how much they are paying for each dollar of earnings. A high PE ratio may indicate overvaluation, while a low PE ratio might indicate undervaluation. Comparing both trailing and forward PE is crucial to understand market expectations.

Price to Book (P/B Ratio):
Measures how much investors are paying for each dollar of a company’s assets. This is helpful when assessing companies that are capital-intensive, like medical devices and pharma.

Profit Margin:
Shows how much of a company’s revenue is retained as profit. It’s a direct measure of profitability and cost control, crucial in comparing efficiency across different companies.
Debt to Equity:

Indicates a company's financial leverage. This is important because a higher debt level might increase financial risk, especially in periods of rising interest rates or economic downturns.
Revenue Growth:

Measures how much a company’s revenue has increased (or decreased) over time, which is essential for companies in high-growth industries like healthcare and medical devices.
Earnings Growth:

Reflects the company's ability to increase its earnings over time. Positive earnings growth is a signal of a healthy, expanding business.
Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA):

These ratios measure how effectively a company is generating profit from its equity (ROE) and assets (ROA). They are useful in comparing profitability across companies.
Gross Margin:

Shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). This is helpful in understanding how well a company controls production costs relative to revenue.
Reason for Including These Metrics
PE Ratios give insight into market valuation, and using both trailing and forward ratios helps gauge both current performance and future growth expectations.
Price to Book is especially relevant in capital-intensive sectors like healthcare, where tangible assets and their values are significant.
Profitability metrics like profit margin, ROE, and ROA help compare operational efficiency and return on investments across different companies.
Leverage metrics such as debt to equity assess financial stability, particularly important in a sector where companies may take on debt for research and development.
Growth metrics (revenue and earnings) are essential for tracking performance and future potential in industries driven by innovation, such as biomedical devices and healthcare.
